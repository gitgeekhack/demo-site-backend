CHEST: Chest wall is stable. There is no seatbelt sign to the anterior neck or anterior chest. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: This is a 55-year-old male who is presenting after a motor vehicle accident with complaint of neck pain. The patient has tenderness to palpation of the midline. He was maintained in C-spine precautions. He did not hit his head or lose consciousness. A CT of the neck was ordered given the severe pain. This was read by Radiology as no acute fracture or subluxation of the cervical spine. The patient's symptoms were improved after he received Norco. An x-ray of the left wrist per my review shows no apparent fracture or dislocation. This is likely a sprain. We will place the patient in a splint for comfort. The patient was reassessed after splint placement and was neurovascularly intact. X-ray of the left shoulder per my review shows no apparent fracture or dislocation. The patient also complains of pain to his lumbar spine. There is no apparent fracture or dislocation per my review of his images. On reassessment, the patient's symptoms are controlled after Norco. We will discharge the patient home. CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Cervical sprain, wrist sprain, and shoulder strain after motor vehicle accident. DISPOSITION: Home in stable condition. We discussed return precautions. The patient will return for any worsening Report Request ID: 6938720 Page 49 of 88 Print Date/Time: 6/6/2016 16:08 PDT ",
